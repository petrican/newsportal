(15, 'New York primary matters for first time in decades', 'New York (CNN)For the first time in decades, New Yorkers are poised to play a crucial role in shaping the presidential nomination process.\r\nAs Empire State voters head to the polls Tuesday, the stakes are highest for front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who are expected to emerge victorious here. And as wildly different as their candidacies are, Trump and Clinton find themselves in a similar position: hoping to gain validation and momentum after a string of disappointments.\r\nTrump badly needs a sweeping win in New York -- if Ted Cruz peels away a significant number of delegates, it will become that much more difficult for Trump to outright clinch the GOP nomination ahead of this summer\'s Republican convention. For Clinton, the challenge has more to do with optics: putting an end to Sanders\' winning streak in the west and undermining his narrative that he\'s the Democrat with the most momentum.\r\n2016 delegate tracker\r\nBoth candidates spent Tuesday morning taking care of their first order of business: voting.\r\n\r\nTrump visited his polling station, the Central Synagogue three blocks east of Trump Tower, where he cast a ballot for himself for the first time.\r\n"It\'s a proud moment. It\'s a great moment. And who would\'ve thought? It\'s just an honor," he told reporters.\r\nClinton was accompanied by her husband, Bill, in her morning stop at the Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua. Campaigning in the state has been a "joy," Clinton said, before urging fellow New Yorkers to vote.\r\n"I had a great time going around the city in the last couple days. Just seeing a lot of old friends, meeting new people," she said.\r\nAs the presidential candidates and national media have descended on New York, local political figures in both parties are relishing the state\'s rare moment in the spotlight of a presidential election.\r\n"It\'s been an unusual circumstance where New York is one of the deciding factors in the Democratic race, so that\'s exciting," said Democratic Queens Borough President Melinda Katz.\r\n\'New Hampshire moment\'\r\nNew York State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox referred to the contests here as his state\'s "New Hampshire moment" -- a reference to the New England state\'s outsized role in the presidential primary.\r\n"This is what the New York state party needs. We need this kind of excitement," Cox said. "We are indeed having our decisive moment in selecting the next president of the United States."\r\nThere are 95 delegates up for grabs in New York in the Republican race. At this stage in the campaign, every single one of those delegates matters.\r\nNYC to Donald Trump: He\'s not one of us\r\nOver the past few weeks, Trump has come face-to-face with the Cruz campaign\'s strong command of the complicated delegate allocation rules. The GOP front-runner has expressed frustration as he\'s watched Cruz walk away with victories and grow his delegate pile -- a sentiment that boiled over after the Texas senator swept the Colorado Republican convention earlier this month.\r\nTrump is becoming increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Republican National Committee and the party\'s nominating process, calling the latter "crooked" and "corrupt."\r\nHow Donald Trump can win the inside delegate game in New York\r\nThere have also been changes within the Trump campaign\'s operations. Perhaps most notably, Trump announced the hire of veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort to oversee the campaign\'s delegate gathering efforts. Meanwhile, Trump\'s national field director, Stuart Jolly, resigned Monday amid a staff shakeup that put Scott Walker\'s former campaign manager in charge of the campaign\'s ground operations.\r\nDemocrats\r\nOn the Democratic side, 247 delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday.\r\nAlthough Clinton continues to have a sizable lead in delegates, the New York race comes after Sanders has won eight of the last nine Democratic contests -- a reality that the Vermont senator has repeatedly touted on the campaign trail.\r\n"I think the Clinton campaign and the secretary are getting a little bit nervous," Sanders told CNN after last week\'s particularly combative Democratic debate in Brooklyn.\r\nSanders has drawn tens of thousands of supporters who his rallies in New York City over the last week. But on Election Day, he signaled that he is turning his focus to the post-New York contests by flying out to campaign in Erie, Pennsylvania.\r\n"You know what? I think we\'re going to win Pennsylvania," he said at an afternoon rally there.\r\nCruz and Kasich also spent the day out of New York.\r\nTuesday\'s contests are particularly significant for three of the candidates who have roots in New York.\r\nWhat to watch in New York\'s primary\r\nTrump is a Queens native and Manhattanite whose famous last name is featured on real estate properties around the city. For Clinton, the current juncture in the race marks something of a homecoming: she was a New York senator for eight years, owns a home in Chappaqua and her campaign headquarters is in Brooklyn. And while Sanders has represented Vermont on Capitol Hill for decades, he was born and raised in Brooklyn and has spoken fondly about his upbringing in the borough.\r\nClinton in particular appeared to delight in campaigning in the five boroughs in recent days. She kept a packed schedule that included riding the subway, drinking bubble tea and sampling dumplings in Brooklyn -- all part of an effort to tour the city and mingle with its residents in relatively casual settings.\r\nBut even as she appeared especially energized here, Clinton took a measured tone during a campaign stop in Flushing, Queens, on Monday. She told reporters that she would not take "anybody or any place for granted."\r\n"I never count any chickens before they hatch. We are going to work hard," she said. "We are going to do everything we can between now and 9 p.m. tomorrow night when polls close here in New York."\r\nIn contrast, Trump has focused most of his campaign efforts in upstate New York. Speaking at a rally in Buffalo Monday night, Trump boasted about "New York values" and called the state a "symbol of American strength in the world."\r\n"We\'re going to show Ted Cruz, who hates New York," Trump said. "No New Yorker can vote for Ted Cruz."', 21, 1, '1461107584', 2),

It has been the source of a decades-long controversy with claims not just from India but Pakistan too.\r\nThe Kohinoor was unearthed in the Golconda mines in central southern India, according to the UK Royal Palace, and passed through the possession of "Mughal princes, Iranian warriors, Afghan rulers and Punjabi Maharajas" before ending up in British hands in 1849.\r\nIt was removed from its Indian setting and recut in 1852 as an oval brilliant.\r\n\'Bring back the Kohinoor\'\r\nA statement from the Indian Ministry of Culture on Tuesday said that the Solicitor General\'s views were not those of the Indian government and it "reiterated its resolve to make all possible efforts to bring back the Kohinoor Diamond in an amicable manner."\r\nThe rare blue rock at center of biggest diamond heist in history...almost\r\nSince Narenda Modi assumed the role of Prime Minister two years ago, India has regained several historic pieces -- including a 10th-century Indian statue of the goddess Durga from Germany, a nearly 900-year-old \'Parrot Lady\' sculpture from Canada and antique statues of Hindu deities from Australia.\r\n\r\n', 22, 1, '1461132496', 2),

The phone has helped investigators address lingering concern that the two may have help, perhaps from friends and family, the officials said.\r\nThe phone didn\'t contain evidence of contacts with other ISIS supporters or the use of encrypted communications during the period the FBI was concerned about. The FBI views that information as valuable to the probe, possibilities it couldn\'t discount without getting into the phone, the officials said.\r\nPrivate sector hackers hired by the FBI helped investigators gain access to the phone, which was at the center of a legal dispute between the government and Apple.\r\nApple was fighting a judge\'s order to help the FBI get past security features to get access to the phone\'s data.\r\n\r\nOne of the points of contention during the legal fight was Apple\'s argument that the FBI already had obtained relevant data from the iCloud account linked to the phone and from other data not stored on the device.

(19, 'Sandy Hook families\' lawsuit against gun makers gets trial date', ' (CNN)A potentially precedent-setting lawsuit against gun manufacturers on behalf of families of those killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting will move forward to the discovery process, a Connecticut judge ruled Tuesday.\r\nThe decision, which also sets an April 3, 2018, trial date, paves the way for depositions and potential access to internal documents from Bushmaster Firearms and Remington.\r\nIt would be the first lawsuit of its kind to reach the discovery phase after the enactment of the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, according to experts\r\n"This is precedent setting in the sense that, after PLCAA, this is the first case against a firearms manufacturer under a negligence theory that looks like it might make it to trial," said Georgia State University law professor Timothy Lytton, who studies gun industry litigation.\r\nThe companies contend they are shielded under the federal legislation, which absolves gun manufacturers from liability if a firearm is "misused" in a crime to kill people.\r\n\r\nThe gun makers have until Friday to file a motion to strike the case, according to court documents.\r\n"This is unusual," Lytton said of the decision\'s timing. "Courts normally decide first whether or not they think the legal theories are valid before they allow the parties — the plaintiff in particular — to run around and dig up evidence that might support their case in a trial."\r\nHe added, "In this instance what the judge is saying is, \'Go ahead, collect your facts before it\'s decided whether there are grounds to dismiss.\'"\r\nJudge Barbara Bellis last week denied Bushmaster Firearms and Remington\'s motion to dismiss the case but said the filing of a motion to strike the case would be more appropriate.\r\nA source close to the defense downplayed Tuesday\'s developments as procedural.\r\n"The reality is, every case gets a scheduling order with a trial date. There\'s nothing unique about what happened today," said the source, adding that defendants have filed a motion seeking to stay discovery.\r\nThe families of the Sandy Hook victims argue that while the guns may not in themselves be unsafe, Bushmaster and Remington\'s marketing strategy deliberately targets young men, some of whom are inclined to violence.\r\nThe families are demanding access to the companies\' marketing documents.\r\nThe families also allege that weapons originally designed for the military have become common in the civilian marketplace.\r\nThe case has the potential to make history if it goes to trial. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers immunity from any lawsuit related to injuries that result from criminal misuse of their product.\r\nOn December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza fatally shot his mother and then drove to the school, where he used a Bushmaster AR-15 to shoot to death 20 children and six adults.

Security Council, by the United States on its own, or by a group of like-minded states from the European Union and Southeast Asia, along with the United States.\r\n\r\nNorth Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month, triggering expanded U.N. sanctions aimed at starving it of funds for its atomic weapons program.\r\n\r\nSome experts expect North Korea to conduct a fifth nuclear test in the near future, possibly before a ruling party congress in early May, following an embarrassing failure of a test of an intermediate-range missile last week.\r\n\r\nEstimates of North Korean workers abroad vary widely but a study by the South\'s state-run Korea Institute for National Unification put the number as high as 150,000, primarily in China and Russia, sending back as much as $900 million annually. North Koreans are known to work abroad in restaurants and on construction sites, and also as doctors.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of current, or any new, sanctions depends heavily on them being fully implemented by China, North Korea\'s neighbor, the closest thing it has to an ally and by far its largest trading partner, U.S. officials and analysts say.\r\n\r\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said all sides should refrain from doing or saying anything to worsen tensions, and remain calm and exercise restraint to get the talks process back on track.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to answer a hypothetical question," she told a news briefing on Wednesday, when asked if China would support new, tougher sanctions in the event of another nuclear test.\r\n\r\nIf the North were to test a fifth nuclear device, the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan could also take unspecified "defense-related measures," Russel said.\r\n\r\n"As the threat grows, then our defensive capabilities need to adjust as well," he said, stressing that there was also a diplomatic route that the North could take by reviving long-dormant negotiations on curbing its nuclear program.\r\n\r\nMORE WEIGHT ON SANCTIONS\r\n\r\nSouth Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee downplayed the prospect that an upcoming visit to New York by North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong to attend a U.N. climate conference would create an opening for engagement.\r\n\r\n"At a time when the North is talking of more provocation, I think it\'s time to put more weight on sanctions rather than dialogue," Jeong told a briefing in Seoul on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nRussel laid out what he called the possible "universe" of how the U.S. government and others might respond to a fifth test and he acknowledged that sanctions have failed to deter North Korea, which tested its first nuclear device in October 2006. He stressed that no decisions had yet been made and said he could not preview a response to an event that has yet to occur.\r\n\r\nU.S. General Vincent Brooks, whom President Barack Obama has nominated to lead American forces in South Korea, said on Tuesday that China was frustrated over North Korea\'s behavior, including its nuclear advances, but was unwilling to apply pressure that could threaten the viability of Kim Jong Un\'s government.\r\n\r\nBrooks also said Kim appeared more "risk-tolerant, arrogant and impulsive" than his father, Kim Jong Il. He was more aggressive in ignoring international concerns while advancing the North\'s nuclear program, the general said.\r\n\r\nRussel said it would take time to judge how well the latest sanctions were being enforced, but Beijing had "exhausted traditional options of encouraging and cajoling and persuading the North Koreans and they have clearly shifted to the application of pressure."\r\n\r\n"There is an argument to be made that serious and sustained pressure on North Korea has never before been undertaken," he said. "The degree to which the North Korean economy depends on China and access to China is such that this stated resolve on the part of China, I think, constitutes something of a new ball game."\r\n\r\nHowever, Frank Jannuzi, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer for East Asia and the Pacific, voiced skepticism that China had had a change of heart and was now willing to apply much more significant pressure on the North.\r\n\r\n"The Chinese are the one country that still has economic leverage but they are reluctant to put it to full use because they don’t think it’ll work and they are worried about the costs," he said, citing long-standing Chinese fears that severe sanctions could trigger "conflict, or refugees, or turmoil."\r\n\r\n', 31, 1, '1461145760', 3),

(27, 'Japan Inc would gain by fixing M&A sights on home', 'Japan could benefit from setting its deal-making sights on home. Companies have been busy buying overseas when it would make more sense to consolidate fragmented domestic industries. With Japanese firms under pressure to become better-run and more profitable, a recent string of tie-ups could be just the start.\r\n\r\nConsolidation was traditionally seen as a last resort for failing companies in the world’s third-largest economy. Corporate rivalries are fierce, and domestic mergers imply painful job cuts. In the last few months, however, Japan has played host to sizeable deals in a number of sectors.\r\n\r\nRetailers FamilyMart and UNY Group merged, while Toyota took full control of smaller carmaker Daihatsu. Oil refiners Idemitsu and Showa Shell are joining forces. In financial services, Nippon Life Insurance bought rival Mitsui Life, while Ashikaga acquired Joyo, another regional bank.\r\n\r\nThere could be plenty more activity ahead. From Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on down, Japan’s establishment wants to ensure shareholders are treated better, and that companies lift their return on equity from disappointing to internationally respectable.\r\n\r\nOne obvious lever for bosses to pull would be to take out local competitors. Though many sectors boast one or two heavyweights, a long tail of also-rans that provide unrelenting competition while making terrible returns usually trail behind. The benchmark Topix index includes more than 50 banks with market values of less than $1 billion.\r\n\r\nCLSA strategist Nicholas Smith last year laid out how many other industries – from food products and construction to chemicals and car components – were highly diffuse, based on standard measures of industry concentration. That presents an opportunity for deals, especially now that Japan’s anti-trust regulator pays more attention to global competition. And as more workers approach retirement, labour forces can shrink with fewer layoffs.\r\n\r\nOne motivation for Japan Inc to shop abroad is to escape a shrinking home market. So domestic consolidation is not the answer to every problem. On the plus side, home-grown deals would be cheap – the Topix’s constituents trade on an average of just 12.3 times forward earnings, Datastream shows. Buying in a familiar market reduces risk. And uniting with direct rivals typically brings more cost savings than foreign adventures. All-Japanese deals would be a type of M&A that investors could get behind.', 33, 1, '1461146033', 3);
